Sure! Here's a more detailed and polished version of your README, expanding on the three parts and adding helpful sections like installation, usage, and contribution guidelines:

# ViLM

ViLM (Vietnamese Language Model) is an end-to-end pipeline for building and deploying a Transformer-based language model for Vietnamese. This repository includes all the necessary components to:

- **Build a tokenizer from scratch**
- **Train a standard Transformer-based language model**
- **Run optimized inference using C for deployment speed**

The project is split into three main parts:

---

## 🔤 1. [Build Tokenizer](https://github.com/vietnlp/vilm/tree/main/tokenizer)

We use a subword tokenizer based on [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) to efficiently tokenize Vietnamese text.

### Features:
- Preprocessing for Vietnamese-specific text normalization.
- Train SentencePiece BPE or Unigram model.
- Export tokenizer vocab and configurations for training and inference.

### How to use:
```bash
cd tokenizer
python train_tokenizer.py --input data/vietnamese_corpus.txt --model_type bpe --vocab_size 32000
```

---

## 🧠 2. [Build Model](https://github.com/vietnlp/vilm/tree/main/model)

This component trains a Transformer-based Language Model (like GPT-style or BERT-style) from scratch using PyTorch.

### Features:
- Transformer encoder or decoder architecture.
- Custom training loop with logging and checkpointing.
- Supports multi-GPU and mixed precision training (via PyTorch Lightning or native AMP).

### How to train:
```bash
cd model
python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

---

## ⚡ 3. [Inference](https://github.com/vietnlp/vilm/tree/main/inference)

This module converts trained models into an optimized format and runs inference using C/C++ for maximum performance.

### Features:
- Convert PyTorch model to ONNX or a custom format.
- C-based runtime for fast and efficient inference.
- Benchmarking tools and latency profiling.

### How to run:
```bash
cd inference
make
./vilm_infer --model_path model.bin --input_text "Xin chào thế giới"
```

---

## 📦 Installation

You’ll need Python 3.8+, PyTorch, and CMake for building the inference engine.

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build C++ inference engine
cd inference
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
